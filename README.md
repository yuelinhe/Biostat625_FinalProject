# Biostat 625 Final Project - Group 1

This is the repository for the project *Impact of COVID-19 and other factors on self-reported mental health in the United States (2020)*, and it contains the work we have done for the final project of the course Biostatistics 625, including code, output, and the report.

The project used 2020 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data to investigate the associated factors of mental health illness during 2020 in the United States and, with a specific focus on COVID-19 related health status. This repository does not contain our source data because of its large sample size. To replicate our work or run our code, please download the data from the CSV data file link under the "Sample Adult Interview" section in [this](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/2020nhis.htm) link. Dataset codebook can be found in [this](https://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/Health_Statistics/NCHS/Dataset_Documentation/NHIS/2020/adult-codebook.pdf) link.
